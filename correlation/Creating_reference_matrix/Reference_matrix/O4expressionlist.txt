Steps to creating the reference matrix

1. Ben Barres mRNA from human brain tissues:

df2 = select(df, Gene.symbol,Astrocytes,Neuron,Oligodendrocyte.Precursor.Cell,Newly.Formed.Oligodendrocyte,
Myelinating.Oligodendrocytes,Microglia,Endothelial.Cells) 

selected expression of genes:
expression_list = df2 %>% filter(Gene.symbol == "Aqp4"| Gene.symbol == "Slc1a3"| Gene.symbol == "Hepacam" | Gene.symbol == "Cd44" | Gene.symbol == "Cd24a" | Gene.symbol == "Fut4" | Gene.symbol == "Cxcr4" | Gene.symbol == "Pdgfra" |Gene.symbol == "Itgb2" |
Gene.symbol == "Tfrc" | Gene.symbol == "Prom1"| Gene.symbol == "Map2k2" | Gene.symbol == "Nes" | Gene.symbol == "Gfap")

Saved the output.

Reordered so that only the surface markers are at the top.  
Take the mean of the new and old oligodendrocytes.
I’ve kept the microglia for now. 

Later I’ll read in the data an z-score and scale before making a large dataframe.

Possible proxies for O4

MYT1, NKX2.2, NKX6.2, SOX10, SOX17, ZFP488, ZFP536, OLIG1, OLIG2
I will try NKX2.2, NKX6.2
The expression in Lake brain has some NKX2.2 in astrocyte, high in oligos.  I will use NKX6-2 it is higher in oligo and opc and very low/none in astros. For the single cell HCL

For the Ben Barres data I’m taking the whole list 


2. Single cell sequencing.
a) http://bis.zju.edu.cn/HCL/search.html   

1. Took lake adult brain.
Neurons: average of all neurons types except pukinji and granual cells
astrocytes: average of two types

b) fetal midbrain lamanno
Neurons: took average of Sert, DA, GABA
NPC = neuroblast
Radial glia : average of three Rg 
Neural crest: plate
I’ll take Mg to mean microglia

I’m also marker DA separately

c) Brain adult temperal lobe1

microglia – three
not neurons so I didn’t take this

d) zhang fetal brain
very few clusters – stem cells, OPC, Neuron, Microglia, GABAergic neuron, astroctyte
- take average of Neuron and GABAergic neurons

e) fetal brain 3
12 clusters:  2 proliferating cells – these I will average as stem cells
Radial glia – two kinds average
There is a neuron cluster and purkinje – Ill just take the neuron NEUROD6high
One cluster is Erythoid cell – a blood cell type 

f) fetal brain 5 – most cells
12 clusters
several blood cells and fibreblasts not taking measures
One neuron cluster
Ependymal counting as epithealia
Proliferating cell – counting as stem cells
Proliferating radial glia 
no astrocytes


UCSC Cell Browser – human cerebral organoids
- I need to download the data – remake the clusters and search the gene list.
Need the file names to download all the info the link doesn’t work 
trying command line

sudo wget --no-check-certificate  https://cells.ucsc.edu/organoidreportcard/organoids10X/organoidsmatrix_nonorm.txt.gz

I need to take all the files probably
- file is very large : it estimates 20minutes download.


There are instructions to read things into R on the website
