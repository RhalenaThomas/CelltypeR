---

An R library with functions for a work flow to use flow cytometry to quantify cell types within a complex tissue.

R library "CelltypeR"

Workbooks:
- Workbooks using the CelltypeR workflow and functions for each data set analysis
- Workbooks with all code used to generate figures.

FlowCytometry_Data: 
- raw flow cytometry data organized by data set

ExampleOuts:
- reference matrix for correlation predicitons
- trained random forest classifier for predictions
- statistics outputs

Rscripts: 
- Analysis using CelltypeR for larger amounts of data run outside workbooks

CelltypeR: 
- this folder contains all library documents
- All functions are in the file CelltypeR.R
