\title{Add the consensus of annotations to a Seurat object from a list}
\usage{
cluster_annotate(seu, ann.list, annotation_name, to_label)
}
\description{
This function takes in a list of data frames with different annotation options.
Use at least 2 options.  If you simple want to add annotations use "annotate",
which is called by this function.The data frames can be created in R, read in
from a csv of txt or created with the "get_annotations" function. All names are
changed to lower case letters.  Cell type names must be exactly the same to match.
For example "astrocytes" and "Astrocytes" will be considered the same, but
"astrocytes" and "astrocyte" will not. The data slot to annotate must be indicated.
To label the data slot with the consensus annotation set annotation_name. For example
annotation_name = "CellTypeCon".
