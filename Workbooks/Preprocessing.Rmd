Read in FlowJO fsc files of gated 
Downsample if desired
Merge
Transform, align, retro-transform if desired
create a dataframe and save csv as the input for creating a seurat object for clustering



```{r}

# Set an input pathway to a folder containing fsc files.  All files in the folder will be read in
input_pathway <- "pathway/to/files"
input_pathway <- "pathway/to/files"



```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
