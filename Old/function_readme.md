### find_correlation()
Find correlation between the test matrix and the reference matrix. 
Compare pre-processed expression matrix with the expected value for each cell type, return the best and second best correlated cell types for each sample in the expression matrix.

#### input
**test_path:** The test matrix in .csv format.

**reference_path:** The reference matrix in .csv format.

**output_path:** Where the output will be saved

**min_corr:** The minimal correlation that will be accepted. If lower than this value, the cell will be labeled with "unknown" cell type. By default, the value is 0.1


**min_diff:** The minimal difference between the best correlation and the second-best correlation. If smaller than this value, the cell will be labeled with a mixed cell type -- "best-correlated - second-best-correlated" cell type. By default, the value is 0.05


#### output
Generate csv and plots pdfs.


### stats_plot()
Plot 3 statistics that measures the quality of the clustering -- silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index and Davies–Bouldin index.  
This function is used by flowSOM clustering or phenograph clustering.

#### input
**stats_ls:** a dataframe generated by the clustering functions (for example: louvain_clustering), the dataframe should contain columns: kn, nc, si, ch, db -- corresponding to k-nearest neighbor, number of clusters, silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index and Davies–Bouldin index.

**output_path:** Where the output will be saved

**input_name:** The name of the input, for example: "flowSOMalign". It will be part of the plot names for identifying purpose.

#### output
Generate 1 pdf per stats method. Within each pdf, there are 2 plots, one with the number of clusters as x-axis, one with the k-nearist neighbour as x-axis. In both cases, the statistical result (si, ch, db) will be the y-axis.

#### output 
3 pdf in total will be generated, and each pdf accounts for one of the three stats method. Within each pdf, there are 2 plots, one with the number of clusters as x-axis, one with the k-nearist neighbour as x-axis. In both cases, the statistical result (si, ch, db) will be the y-axis. On each plot, statistical outcome for all three types of clustering methods will be displayed and compared.
