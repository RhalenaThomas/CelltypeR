After creating the flowset object try to cluster directly
This is using 9MBO where I subset 9000 cells per cluster (one sample had less)

FlowSOM recommends starting with the fcs files directly 


```{r}

BiocManager::install("FlowSOM")
library("FlowSOM")

```
Clustering using scripts from past Rhalena/Alex notebooks
